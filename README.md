# 🤖 Smart Manufacturing Machines Efficiency Prediction

## 📌 Problem Statement
In modern manufacturing environments, machine inefficiencies result in production losses, energy waste, and increased maintenance costs. There is a need for an intelligent system that can predict machine efficiency levels in real-time using operational sensor data.

## 💡 Proposed System Features
- Data cleaning, encoding, and scaling
- Feature selection using Random Forest and ANOVA
- Multi-model training: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve
- Web deployment using Streamlit for real-time predictions
- Models saved using `joblib`
